# Simple NFT Gallery

## Project Description
Simple NFT Gallery is a decentralized platform that allows users to mint and showcase NFTs. The smart contract stores NFTs along with their metadata and provides a way to retrieve all created NFTs.

## Project Vision
The goal of the Simple NFT Gallery is to provide an immutable, transparent, and secure way to store and display NFTs on the blockchain. The project aims to make NFT management simple and efficient.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with IPFS** for decentralized metadata storage.
- **Support for multiple owners** with fractional NFT ownership.
- **Filtering and categorization** for better browsing.
- **Auction and sales features** to enable NFT trading.

## Key Features
- **Mint NFTs** with unique token IDs and metadata.
- **Retrieve NFT details** such as ID, metadata, and owner.
- **View all NFTs** in the gallery.
- **Check owned NFTs** by querying the ownerâ€™s collection.

This project serves as the foundation for a more advanced NFT gallery with potential future upgrades.
